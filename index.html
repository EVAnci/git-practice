            What is Git?
        </h1>
        <div class="container p-4">
            <p>Git is a distributed version control system that enables multiple developers to track changes in source code during software development. It facilitates collaboration by allowing individuals to manage revisions, branch out from the main codebase, and merge code changes effectively. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git provides each developer with a local copy of the full project history, improving performance and flexibility for offline work.</p>
            <p>For a more formal definition:</p>
            <p>"Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project, tracking every change made to files, enabling reverting to earlier states, and supporting branching and merging workflows."</p>
